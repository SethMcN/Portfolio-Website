                    <p>This is the first website I created while learning web development. The project showcases basic web design and JavaScript functionality:</p>
                    <p>1. Nearby Burger Restaurants: A button in the center of the page, when clicked, redirects the user to Google Maps and displays nearby burger restaurants, helping users find the best spots for a meal.</p>
                    <p>2. Drawing Board: An interactive canvas where users can draw their own burgers. The board includes:</p>
                    <p>• A palette of colors (e.g., red, yellow, green, etc.).</p>
                    <p>• Adjustable brush sizes ranging from "X Small" to "XX Large."</p>
                    <p>• An eraser tool for edits.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>This is how the website looked during the first stage of development, there was a simple navigation bar with links to different pages </p>

                    <!-- Description of the addition of the dropdown menu -->
                    <p>Next, I added a dropdown menu to the navigation bar for coding languages I have learned and am currently learning.<p>

                    <!-- Description of the first stage of development -->
                    <p>I updated the color scheme, but the dropdown menu ended up slightly misaligned in position and font size compared to the rest of the site. This required further research to identify the cause of the issue.</p>

                    <!-- Description of the addition of the dropdown menu -->
                    <p>To resolve the issue, I redesigned the CSS file for the navbar to ensure that all text is effected in the same way. This adjustment made the text within the a tags match the appearance of the text in the buttons.</p>
